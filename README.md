Travelling Data Analysis

Hello, everyone! I'm excited to share my second Power BI Project Report, As a data analyst and Power BI developer, I have created a comprehensive Travel Analytics Dashboard designed to provide valuable insights into the travel industry. This dashboard consists of two main pages: an Overview and a detailed Report.

ðŸ“ŠOverview Page: The Overview page serves as a high-level snapshot of the travel data, offering a quick glance at key metrics and trends. Here's what you can find on this page:

#Total_States: This metric displays the total number of states or regions covered in our travel data, helping us understand the geographic scope of our analysis.

#Total_People: Here, we showcase the overall number of travelers within the dataset, giving an idea of the scale of travel activity.

#Total_Hotels: This figure represents the total count of hotels in the dataset, shedding light on the accommodation options available. Average Hotel Rating: This metric offers insights into the quality of hotels, presenting an average rating based on customer feedback.

#Total_Bookings: We provide the total count of bookings made, indicating the demand for travel services.

#Total_GST_Price: This represents the cumulative Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue generated from travel-related transactions, contributing to the economy.

#Total_Destinations: The number of unique travel destinations covered in our dataset is displayed, showcasing the diversity of travel experiences.

#Average_Age: This metric calculates the average age of travelers, helping identify the typical age group that engages in travel activities.

ðŸ“ˆReport Page: The Report page is where the detailed analysis unfolds. It offers a deeper dive into the data, enabling users to explore trends, patterns, and insights in more detail. Here, you'll find comprehensive reports, charts, and graphs that provide a granular understanding of the travel industry.
